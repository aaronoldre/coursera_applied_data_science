Seattle is a wonderful city, but my job is relocating me to another location. I am offered the option of going to Austin, Portland, Denver, or Baltimore. I like Seattle and the neighborhood I live in with the restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and bars all within walking distance of my house. Can I find similar neighborhoods in these new cities with housing similar to what I have now?
